# Efficient Pseudo Clique Enumeration

This project aims to parallelize and optimize the code for solving the Pseudo Clique Enumeration problem, based on the research paper 'An Efficient Algorithm for Solving Pseudo Clique Enumeration Problem' by Takeaki Uno

This project takes the original code and aims to improve its efficiency by parallelizing the code. The goal is to reduce the computation time and make the algorithm more scalable for larger datasets.
